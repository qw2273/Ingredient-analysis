The website that I use is [Beautypedia](https://www.beautypedia.com) that provides detailed information on thousands of products. This project will restrain its focus on skincare products, specidically on moisturizer and eyecream products.  "

If you decide to use Chrome, please make sure webdrivrer vesion is matched with your browser version, otherwise it will cause errors later. Installation guide can be found at https://selenium-python.readthedocs.io/installation.html. \n",

    "    - I think Data cleaning part on text data on ingredients is really hard. One reason is that for different products, the way that manufacture named ingredients differs from one to another, like some named water as aqua water. Besides, there are some spelling mistakes in ingerdients list, for example, '2-oleamido-1' is written as '2-oleamindo-1'. So this actually increase feature space.\n",
