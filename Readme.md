- Every day, I apply toner, daytime moisturizer, eye cream, nighttime moisturizer on my face. Sometimes, I keep wondering what are in these products? Are they safe? Or for some pricy products, do their ingredients differ from others? Does there exist any substitute for these pricy ones?  
Thus, I decide to use this final project as an opportunity to take a closer look at some skincare products and find ones that similar in ingredients. 

- The project idea is inspired by a practiced project on data-camp, but the dataset is not downloadable, so I decided to do scrape some data by myself. The website that I use is [Beautypedia](https://www.beautypedia.com) that provides detailed information on thousands of products. This project will restrain its focus on skincare products, specifically on moisturizer and eye-cream products.  

The following two screenshots show the visualization of analysis results. The bokeh interactive plots not only indicates the product information in details but also allow the user to choose the type and rating to show the related products. On the plot, if two points are close to each other, it means that these two products have similar ingredients.
